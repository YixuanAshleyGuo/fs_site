Fixed 
missing semicolon on line 214            
missing semicolon on line 131

Not fixed:
variables come up as undefined when they are defined in other file: This is not an actual error however, because the analyzer does not account for what has been defined in index.html. Code was inspected by Erik Dyer, recorded by Gergana Alteva.
